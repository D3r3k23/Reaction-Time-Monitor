## Reaction Time Monitor

This was a lab project for my digital systems class, using the VHDL language. The project was designed to use the FPGA on the [Blackboard](https://www.realdigital.org/). The system waits for the user to push the "start" button, and then waits a random time between 1 and 10 seconds. Then an LED on the board lights up, and the user's reaction speed, or the time it takes for him to push the "react" button, is shown in the 7 segment display.
